Tasks:
- Copy to clipboard: make it work with terminal=false, same for pomodoro projects.
- Pomodoro plugin: show tasks for all the projects!
- BitBar: also count my current rate in different currencies.
- BitBar: copy to clipboard doesn't work anymore.
- Download FIO data daily and add stats to BitBar. Possibly use those in determining my burn rate.
